#Multi-formula multi-dataset survminer plots

This repository shows a way on how to generate survival probability plots using the R <i>survimner</i> library when there are multiple different formulas and corresponding datasets. In addition, it shows how to combine these with a custom graph layout and save the plots programatically.
